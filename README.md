    * Because similar terms of racial identity are capitalized
        * Asian, Asian-American
        * African-American
        * European
    * It better reveals the intent of the concept of whiteness
        * Which is to be a way to socially categorize people into the "haves" and the "have-nots"
        * By defining who counted as "white", they got to decide whether they needed as many people to serve as the "boogie man" to keep down
* Is it OK to refer to someone as "that Black person"?
    * Probably, assuming you would have used "that White person" in the same context
	* Probably not, if there is some other characteristic that would better describe the person
        * Like if "that guy in the red hat" would be sufficient to distinguish them within a group
* What about the poor treatment of the Irish?
    * The Irish are now considered White, with the privileges that entails
        * Most Black people still haven't gotten those privileges
	* You've probably been to a parade celebrating Irish heritage (St. Patrick's Day)
    * Have you been to a parade celebrating African-American heritage (Juneteenth?)
